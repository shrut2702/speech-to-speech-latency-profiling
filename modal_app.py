A benchmark is a job, not a service: one long invocation that sets up, runs
every config, writes to durable storage and exits. The cold start is paid once,
before any measured trial, and the container's disposability stops mattering.

One container with three GPUs, not a function per stage. Separate functions land
in separate containers on separate machines, so everything the stages exchange
would cross a network, and for a pipeline measured in milliseconds that hop is
not a detail, it is the measurement. Inside the container each stage still gets
its own process and its own card, which the harness handles.

Results go to a folder per config on the volume, committed after each one so a
crash keeps what already finished.
